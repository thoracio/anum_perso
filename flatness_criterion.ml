(*
little implementation of the flatness criterion for the curves,
we use a data structure of points p=(a,b) on the cartesian
coordinates

(*calculates the area of the triangle of vertices (a,fa) (b,fb) (m,fm) where m is some
point between the segment [a,b] and fa,fb,fm are their respectives images by the fonction f
